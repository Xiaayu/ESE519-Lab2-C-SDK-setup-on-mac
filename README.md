## Setup Guide 


### Pre-work: MacOS Compatibility Setup
For Macs with Apple Silicon(M1/ M2) is better to use an x86 version of the Homebrew package manager to ease compatibity issues.

* Duplicate the "terminal" in application folder and rename it with "x86" in addtion to differ from the original one:

* Right click, get info and check the box for "open use Rosetta"

* Install Homebrew on "Terminal x86"
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```


### Step 1: Installing the Toolchain
After installing Homebrew, then install the toolchain in the terminal:
```
$ brew install cmake
$ brew tap ArmMbed/homebrew-formulae
$ brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
```
Once the toolchain is installed there are no differences between macOS and Linux.


### Step 2: Get the SDK and Examples
We can download the [pico-sdk](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) and [pico-examples](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples) directly.

Or use the terminal to create a pico directory at ../user/pico:
```
$ cd ~/
$ mkdir pico
$ cd pic
```
And then clone the pico-sdk and pico-examples git repositories:
```
$ git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
$ cd pico-sdk
$ git submodule update --init
$ cd ..
$ git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples.git
```

### Step 3: Using Visual Studio Code and Building with CMake Tools
* Installing VSCode
[Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is a cross platform environment and runs on macOS, as well as Linux, and Microsoft Windows. [Download MacOS version](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and drag it to Applications Folder.

* Building with CMake Tools

In the left bar find "extension" and search for "CMake Tools", entry the list and click install button.

Set the PICO_SDK_PATH environment variable. Navigate to the pico-examples directory and create a .vscode directory and add a file called settings.json to tell CMake Tools to location of the SDK.
